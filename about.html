        Hi, I am Bhargav. I am currently building <a href="https://getgreenlit.xyz">Greenlit</a>, solutions and speed for filmmakers, studios, production companies, and IP holders. Previously, I was at 5 healthcare/AI/fintech startups that (mostly) shutdown and learned mostly what not to do.
        
        I grew up in Jersey and studied engineering at Rutgers. During this time I interned/worked/consulted at many organizations big and small mostly making software among other things. I have been working with founders and CTO's since 2015. Generally a creative and problem solver. I enjoy tackling big problems in a small detailed manner and asking/thinking about the big questions in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the side I also invest in startups and in India. I also co-produce films (though nothing has been released yet). If you are working on a film/tv/anime/doc or building a startup, feel free to reach out.
      </p>

      <!-- <p>
        Technical chops (for you people inspecting this):

          I do everything but the frontend (as you can clearly tell by this page and I do enjoy great design and UIs. These days primarily: devops, infra, data eng/data infra. Strong: Python, Java; Some: Go, C; Less: Ruby, Node.js, ES6. I've used every major service in AWS and yes the UI still has issues which is funny cause its mostly devops using it and the trend is to go to infra as code paradigm (AWS if you are reading please invest more in frontend). Most the code I've written is closed source, although that will slowly shift. Have worked on scaling issues, data ETL pipes, full infra setups from scratch, among many other things. Vim 4ever ;)
