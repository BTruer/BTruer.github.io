        I live in North Jersey and am currently building <a href="https://getgreenlit.xyz">Greenlit</a>, an IP/copyright licencing and royalties marketplace for filmmakers, IP holders, and licensees. Perviously I was at 2 healthcare startups that shutdown and learned what not to do. There are real problems in healthcare (around the world and in the US) and there are definitely slow and incremental ways to solve them so all people can have good health and that there is not waste. I grew up in Jersey and studied engineering at Rutgers. During this time I interned/worked/consulted at many organizations big and small mostly making software among other things. I have been working with founders and CTO's since 2015. Generally a creative and problem solver. I enjoy tackling big problems in a small detailed manner and asking/thinking about the big questions in life. Always a work in progress and accepting of the present. 
        <!-- I am a hobbyist film maker, producer, and amature voice actor. Don't bother looking me up tho I have an alias for creative stuff. -->

        Technical chops (for fellow coders):

          I do everything but the frontend (as you can clearly tell by this page and I do enjoy great design and UIs. These days primarily: devops, infra, data eng/data infra. Strong: Python, Java; Some: Go, C; Less: Ruby, Node.js, ES6. I've used every major service in AWS and yes the UI still has issues which is funny cause its mostly devops using it and the trend is to go to infra as code paradigm (AWS if you are reading please invest more in frontend). Most the code I've written is closed source, although that will slowly shift. Have worked on scaling issues, data ETL pipes, full infra setups from scratch, among many other things. Vim 4ever ;)
