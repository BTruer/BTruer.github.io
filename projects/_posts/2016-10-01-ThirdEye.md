### When
At HackRU Fall October 2016 - Rutgers University

### Who
Bhargav Sonani, Nicholas Grieco, Roopesh K, Dhuvesh Patel, and I
![alt text](images/3rdeye/3eye7.jpg "We the people")

### What
We build a VR mapping to camera system. Basically a user will put on the Oculus Rift. As the the user moves their head left and right a camera the real world will move one to one with the user.

### The Process
![ERROR picture not found](images/3rdeye/3eye5.JPG "System Diagram")
We built this system using the following components:
* A desktop running our unity application
* Oculus Rift
* A web server to pass data
* Raspberry Pi
* Ardunio
* Step Motor
* Android Phone
Here is what the process:
1. User's headset is rotated about a plane x; The current angle of the headset in axis x is sent to the unity application in real time (so some angle x_t)
2. This angle is then sent to the server over a TCP socket connection (ideally) from the unity application
3. This angle gets forwarded to the raspberry pi over a socket connection as well (in our case we made the raspberry pi run the socketserver so it reduced a step)
4. This angle is converted to a binary representation and then transmitted over IO pins
5. The ardunio receives input signals from its IO in pins and it translates the angle to an amount to rotation and a direction.
6. The ardunio sends a signal to the step motor to rotate a certain amount
7. A phone sits on top of the rotating motor (in our case a piece of cardboard box was being rotated)
8. The Android phone sends realtime footage to the unity application over droidcam which an IPcam
9. The user sees the updated video in realtime

### Results
Won "Most Innovative Use of Artificial Intelligence to Control Hardware from Siemens"
Enjoyment and left with more knowledge then when I started

### What I learned
Why you should not use an http webserver or a restful service to pass realtime data
How to not make a socket connection
(Eventually) how to make socket connections
Storing key-values in memory is fast
