<h1>STEAM vs STEM: humanities are underrated</h1>

    When I was a freshman at Rutgers, often other engineers would joke about art
    majors. They criticized them as how easy it must be. I found this very strange.
    Did they know art majors? What did these engineering students do in their free
    time? They watched Netflix. They played video games. They listened to music, who
    are literally called artists. People who write and produce: what did they study?
    Often humanities, the arts, design, literature, language or something of that
    nature (you can get this data by scraping linkedin btw p.s. they don’t like
    bots). Also what is easy and difficult is very relative to an individual. Sure
    you can argue some courses have exam styles or lesser work loads therefore those
    courses are easier. Generalizing difficulty to an entire major is that: a
    generalization. One person might find X subject super easy and another might
    find Y to be difficult (though I think everyone can agree organic chemistry is
    notoriously difficult wherever you are haha).

    STEM stands for: science, technology, engineering and mathematics

    STEAM stands for: science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics

    In 2001 the NSF introduced the acronym to encourage students to be competitive
    in the global economy to prepare students to enter the workforce. “Those areas
    were seen as being crucial to maintaining U.S. prosperity.” <a
    href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/STEM-education">src</a> So basically some
    people high up thought there will be a shortage of people with skills needed to
    fill jobs entering the workforce and as a result created STEM initiatives to
    encourage students to enter these disciplines. This as well students who are
    overwhelmingly under represented in those areas to enter those fields. This was
    an admirable effort from our government. However, there are some problems with
    this: <a

    </p>
    <p>
    STEAM appears to me like a petty backhanded way to put humanities back in after
    an over emphasis on STEM. Like even the weight in the acronym is imbalance: 4 to
    1.
    </p>

    Universities and colleges often have requirements that students must take
    elective courses outside of their major. This is especially true if the major
    you are in is a specialized program: business, engineering, pharmacy etc.
    Generally speaking, the purpose of this requirement is to expand a student's
    interest, knowledge, and understanding by taking courses in the humanities or
    subjects that one would otherwise not take. This requirement comes from the idea
    of a liberal education, which modern universities and colleges are based on. The
    idea being:<em> “a philosophy of education that empowers individuals with broad
    knowledge and transferable skills, and a stronger sense of values, ethics, and
    civic engagement ... characterised by challenging encounters with important
    issues, and more a way of studying than a specific course or field of study"
    </em>- <a href="https://www.aacu.org/resources/liberal-education">AACU</a>

    I personally got into reading because I was forced to take a writing course
    where I was exposed to great non-fiction writing like that of Malcom Gladwell’s.
    Before that I did not like reading at all.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the economy did not reward stem majors with prospects of jobs and INITIAL
    higher than average incomes etc. I would not be surprised if less students went
    into STEM majors.
    </p>
    <p>
    If we take a look at industries like music, film, literature, design, are often
    actually more competitive to break into. Because you have to BREAK into them.
    Although the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_List_(survey)">blacklist </a>has tried
    to democratize this in Hollywood at least. In these industries the 80/20
    principle is more skewed where it's more 98/2 where 98% of all value generated
    goes to just 2% of creators. I don't have the exact data but the general idea is
    that when it comes to those industries competition for the actual products that
    are consumed by people is fierce. As a result job prospects for those entering
    those fields are limited or tougher to get. Not all people who study humanities
    enter those industries and there are some STEM majors who make their way in too.

    Recently, GTP3 was able to write a program given a doc string. Trained on source
    code from Github, this program was able to write a program…. Very meta. This
    leads me to my next point:

    Mark Cuban says the majors of the future that will be <a
    href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-cuban-liberal-arts-is-the-future-2017-2#:~:text=Cuban%20highlighted%20English%2C%20philosophy%2C%20and,is%20changing%2C%22%20Cuban%20said.">most
    valuable</a> are actually humanities majors. Because their main edge is
    creativity, thinking in a non systemic way. Systems thinking is very important
    for solving tough technical problems but given that AI can augment most of the
    hard technical tasks, what is the real value add for a human? With AI automating
    the mundane parts of work the real value add of anyone that is a knowledge
    worker is their creativity or doing things computers cannot do.

    <a
    href="https://podcastnotes.org/joe-rogan-experience/elon-musk-neuralink/">Elon
    Musk</a> does not care about your college degree. More so, your ability to solve
    tough problems. He criticizes that there are too many MBAs and too many people
    going into investment banking/finance which is a misallocation of talent.

    <a href="https://youtu.be/AHcsgy5gk58?t=18">Chamath Palihapitiya</a>, the
    outspoken investor at Social Capital called our generation’s Buffet, says that
    we have too much of the best talent going to big tech (FAANG + Microsoft)
    getting paid a ton of money where they end up not real world tough problems.
    This is highlighted well in this meme/comic (credit goes to creator):

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlI1MR-qNt8">Steve Jobs</a> always said
    Apple is the intersection of technology and liberal arts. He said the most
    important course he took in college was calligraphy.

    Tim Ferris suggests studying two unrelated things to be creative and see
    opportunities others do not (like com sci and law, swimming and language etc.)
    (can’t find the exact quote or podcast please send it my way if you find it).

    If we are to create a society with well rounded people, who are empathic and
    thoughtful; Who can tackle problems that arise and step up challenges, the study
    of humanities is necessary. We are not robots. We are humans with conscience,
    emotions, thoughts, and relationships with the world outside.

      Update 1/6/2020:
      College is good for: meeting people who share your interests (and not your interests), meeting interesting professors who might tell very well too, learning about things/subjects you have trouble learning yourself, researching something you would not be able to at home, using some equipment in a lab you would not have access to otherwise.
      Should everyone learn to code? Well just as everyone can read/write in English but not everyone is a writter by profession everyone should learn to read/write code though not everyone needs to be a swe/dev/coder by profession. I think this statement is too idealistic because everyone uses a car everday without understading the laws of therodynamics. Those who are facinated by how something works learn (degree or not). I think everyone should be required to take it as a course in high school becasue it is part of society now. Also it amazes me: there are plenty of people who are able to graduate high school without ever taking physics and/or chemistry?! In these subjects studnets learn the properties of the universe and how it works. It is totally shocking to me that is not required in some places!
