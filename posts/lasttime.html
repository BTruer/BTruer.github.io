<h1>The Last Time Principle</h1>

<p>
  <em>Posted: 07/16/2023</em>
</p>
<p>If this was the last time you were doing something how would you do it?</p>
  <p>Wholeheartedly, with intensity and presence.</p>
  <p>If this was the last time you were spending time with your friends you would be very grateful and present and only share joyful words.</p>
  <p>If this was the last time you were speaking with your mother you might only say what is important and express your love.</p>
  <p>If this was the last time you were working you might do it with intensity and passion as it is the last time you are showing up to your craft.</p>
  <p>If this were the last time you were playing your favorite sport you might play it with such passion and force.</p>
  <p>When we are present to our mortality and do not take this life for granted we can snap out of a default way of being and be full of vigor and exuberance.</p>
  <p>This idea is not mine nor original but from Time management for mortals and other sources stitched together.</p>
